### App for improving kids spelling
<p> If kids are stuck on spelling from A-Z, this little app can help them remember spelling because what this app does is only display 
  the picture only if the whole word matches.

    <h4> Its okay if your kids don't want to type with keyboard </h4>
    <p> With this app technology your kid can both <b> type </b> and <b> draw </b> words. </p>
